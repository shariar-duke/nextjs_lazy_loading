        In his attempts to catch Jerry, Tom often has to deal with Spike ðŸ¦®,
        known as &quot;Killer&quot; and &quot;Butch&quot; in some shorts, an
        angry, vicious but easily duped bulldog who tries to attack Tom for
        bothering him or his son Tyke while trying to get Jerry. Originally,
        Spike was unnamed and mute, aside from howls and biting noises as well
        as attacking indiscriminately, not caring whether it was Tom or Jerry
        though usually attacking Tom.

        In later cartoons, Spike spoke often, using a voice and expressions,
        performed by Billy Bletcher and later Daws Butler, modeled after
        comedian Jimmy Durante. Spike&apos;s coat has altered throughout the
        years between gray and creamy tan. The addition of Spike&apos;s son Tyke
        in the late 1940s led to both a slight softening of Spike&apos;s
        character and a short-lived spin-off theatrical series called Spike and
        Tyke.
